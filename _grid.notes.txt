If I move this layout to a grid, a template area like this would do:

header header header
summary principles principles
....... calendar calendar
booklist booklist booklist
projects technology technology
contact contact .
footer footer .

But, right now everything is good-enough with the old-school positioning-based layout and a
smattering of flexbox, so.
