  <h2>Learn Data APIs and Full-Stack JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    Spend the early part of your summer interacting with web-available data APIs for exchanging and
    mashing up content and data, while extending your skills in JavaScript to the server with
    Node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    This lectureless, discussion-based course will open with a study of APIs in the classical sense:
    as interfaces into programming languages and core modules, specifically JavaScript. An
    understanding and command of JavaScript’s APIs, both in the browser and server-side in Node.js,
    will allow us to explore and manipulate APIs that present data in lightweight data serialization
    formats (e.g., JSON) in a RESTful architecture. Students will have the opportunity to focus on a
    specific use of APIs, such as visualization, “scraping” for the purposes of creating datasets
    for research, or building custom and novel visual interfaces for interacting with a particular
    dataset or service. Throughout the course, students will encounter and learn to address
    challenges surrounding licensing, API request limits, and other legal, ethical, and technical
    issues surrounding terms of service (TOS) and documentation.

  <h2>The Hard Sell: Take This Class</h2>
  <p>
    Whether or not you have professional ambitions in web development, there is no escaping the
    importance of accessing and manipulating data APIs. Additionally, there are numerous other
    higher-level principles and practices that this class introduces or reinforces:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The professional necessity of tracking the development of active open-source projects
    </li>
    <li>
      Better understanding of the processes of authenticating to data services and acting within the
      bounds of terms of service
    </li>
    <li>
      Engaging in collaborative, open development on GitHub while maintaining the security of assets
      such as API keys and tokens
    </li>
    <li>
      Exposure to JavaScript-based methods and patterns for asynchronous, non-blocking I/O
    </li>
    <li>
      Full-stack development that closely knits the front- and back-end logic and execution through
      standards-compliant HTML and client- and server-side JavaScript
    </li>
    <li>
      Intensive work with consoles and loggers to up your debugging game outside of clients and
      browsers
    </li>
    <li>
      Test-driven development (TDD) to ensure code quality and internal consistency, and to
      streamline code reviews
    </li>
  </ul>

      the high end, assuming you opt for the electronic editions at full list price and the optional
      title); and each book should be worthy of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of
      choice long after the class has ended.

<section id="projects">
  <h2>Major Projects</h2>
  <p>
    There will be three major projects in this class: An individually developed browser-based app,
    an individually developed server-side alpha app, and a collaboratively developed server-side
    beta app. Additionally, graduate students will be expected to more deeply investigate both a
    core module from Node.js and a common data serialization format (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV, SOAP,
    YAML) and serve as in-house consultants on them.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="technology">
  <h2>Required Tech Setup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A Unix-like operating system (Linux, BSD, macOS, etc.). Virtualized Linux is fine, but Windows
      is not.
    </li>
    <li>
      A plain-text editor that highlights HTML, CSS, JavaScript syntax. Atom is a fine choice, if
      you have no preferred editor or are looking to try something new.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Node.js JavaScript runtime.
    </li>
    <li>
