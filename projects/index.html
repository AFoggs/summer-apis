        <p>
          Each week, we will all work together through a problem related to the week's readings and
          your progress on the two larger projects. You should post to Basecamp <b>as</b> you are
          working on the problems. Part of their purpose is to help everyone in the class learn to
          work together and compare different approaches to solving challenging problems.

        <h3>Project One: Static API Consumption and Display</h3>
        <small>Due June 17, 11:59pm&nbsp;CT</small>
      </header>
      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will create an Express.js-backed application on top of Node.js that consumes API data
          and presents the data in a useful format tied to some specific user task or information
          need. Your display will be a single HTML page, styled with CSS and progressively enhanced
          with JavaScript as necessary in the browser. Think of your display as something like an
          information dashboard. Your display will contain limited user interaction, other than
          perhaps modifying views of data. But no interaction should trigger the fetching of
          additional data (that will be the focus of Project Two).

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Project must be built with only one valid well-formed HTML file, one valid CSS file,
            and one JavaScript file.
          </li>
          <li>
            All source files in UTF-8/Unicode character encoding with Unix-style line endings (LF),
            entabbed with spaces (two spaces per tab)
          </li>
          <li>
            Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files should all be indented with 2 spaces per level of
            indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all
            rules and blocks inside your media queries. Indent inside of all blocks in JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or
            code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf frameworks). A JavaScript framework
            for basic DOM manipulation is permissible, such as jQuery or a lightweight alternative
            such as Umbrella JS or Shoestring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make use of both the validators and linters to ensure the quality of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantically structured text-based content to accompany all media elements (image,
            audio, video). Make use of the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tags
          </li>
          <li>
            One single valid, linted, error-free CSS file called <code>screen.css</code>. <b>Do
            not</b> create more than one CSS file for your project; all styles should be in the same
            file. Use an <code>id</code> value on <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and leverage that in a CSS descendant selector if you need a
            special style on a particular page.
          </li>
          <li>
            The opening lines of your <code>screen.css</code> file should be the Eric Meyer reset
            CSS styles
          </li>
          <li>
            Use of only relative units (<code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vm</code>,
            <code>%</code>) in your CSS; no <code>px</code>, <code>pt</code>, or other absolute
            units are permitted in your CSS
          </li>
          <li>
            Use at least three min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for
            larger screens
          </li>
          <li>
            Use JavaScript only for progressive enhancement. All site content and basic
            functionality (e.g., clicking links, viewing images and other media, scrolling,
            submitting forms) must still be available even in the absence of JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Absolutely no</b> <code>on-</code> or other deprecated event attributes in your HTML.
            Handle all events via event listeners in your JavaScript. The only element of your HTML
            that should contain any references to JavaScript should be a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
            element that loads your JavaScript file, and possibly also your DOM-manipulation
            framework. In other words, keep your JavaScript unobtrusive to progressively enhance
            your HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using JavaScript to manipulate your CSS whenever possible. Limit JavaScript to
            manipulating the DOM, including adding and removing state classes, and keep style
            information and transitions where they belong: in your CSS file.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately
            reflect each set of changes that you make
          </li>
          <li>
            Your GitHub repository must contain ONLY the files and commits from this project

            Whole team: A project proposal, based in part on your work for Production Problem 02,
            describing:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Who the members are on your team (organize yourselves on Basecamp starting 2/19)

              <li>What kind of booking system you will build</li>
              <li>
                What the URL is to your shared team GitHub repository, and the URLs to each team
                memberâ€™s individual fork of the shared repository
              </li>
              <li>
                Which project-management/communication app (e.g., Basecamp, Slack, Trello, or
                something else) that you will use to communicate with one another to coordinate your
                work and avoid disasters on GitHub and elsewhere.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The proposal should be collaboratively written as a Markdown file in your shared GitHub
            repository (due no later than Sunday, February 25, 11:59pm CT). Designate one member of
            the group to post as a new message thread on Basecamp the URL to the group repo
            containing the proposal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whole team: A screen-by-screen task analysis of existing sites that provide similar
            functionality to your chosen task (again, e.g., booking a flight, purchasing
            reserved-seating tickets to a concert, ordering food for delivery at a specific time).
            Post to Basecamp (due no later than Thursday, March 8, 11:59pm CT).

            Whole team: A video presentation of your teamâ€™s work in progress, hosted on YouTube,
            Vimeo, or another similar service and posted to Basecamp. Your Basecamp post should
            include the URL to your teamâ€™s GitHub repository and a URL to the live site (GitHub
            Pages is fine). Include in the text of your post one or two <b>specific</b> things you
